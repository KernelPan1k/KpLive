KPLive is based on Minimal Linux Live (thanks)

To change the keyboard configuration, you can do (for example):

- loadkeys us (default)
- loadkeys fr
- loadkeys fr_CH

This LiveCD contains 3 custom scripts:

- kprm_restore_hives: restore the backup of the windows registry created by KpRm
- ntfs_attr: see/modify Windows file attributes
- noahdfear_driver.sh: noahdfear script that allows you to disinfect Windows drivers

If you want to mount an NTFS partition you must use ntfs-3g:

- ntfs-3g /dev/sdax /mnt/point
